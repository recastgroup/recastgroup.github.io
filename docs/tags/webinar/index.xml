      <description>Webinar Overview: Join us for a webinar exploring self-directed learning within specific contexts. Our panelists have studied self-directed learning in five distinct sectors (language learning, cybersecurity, behavior analysis, nursing, and game development) and will reflect on the various definitions and models of self-directed learning they have incorporated into their work, the insights and lessons learned about self-directed learning in their contexts, and how self-directed learning should be applied moving forward.</description>
