      <description>Webinar Overview: Join us for a webinar exploring self-directed learning within specific contexts. Our panelists have studied self-directed learning in five distinct sectors (language learning, cybersecurity, behavior analysis, nursing, and game development) and will reflect on the various definitions and models of self-directed learning they have incorporated into their work, the insights and lessons learned about self-directed learning in their contexts, and how self-directed learning should be applied moving forward.</description>

      <description>ED-VOLUTION Summit 2024 presented by LearnTech Initiative AFRICA&#xA;Slides bretsw.com/edvolution24/&#xA;Reflection Every aspect of ED-VOLUTION 2024 was so well-organized, and the production quality was top-notch. My favorite part of the whole speaker experience was the Q&amp;amp;A after my presentation, which turned into a nice chat with Damilare. His questions were excellent for extending and deepening the conversation. It had an informal, fireside chat feel to it. This follow-up prompted me to think and reflect on my topic in new ways.</description>
