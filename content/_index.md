We are the *Research and Exploration of Context-Aware Self-Teaching* (**RECAST**) group, a research team gathered and led by [Dr. Bret Staudt Willet]. We are based in the Instructional Systems and Learning Technologies ([ISLT]) program at Florida State University, but our contributors and collaborators are global in scope.

While RECAST is an acronym, we also appreciate the play-on-words. In tabletop games like *Dungeons & Dragons*, the D20 {{< awesome fas fa-dice-d20 >}} (i.e., 20-sided die) is rolled (i.e., cast) to determine the success of an action. In some cases, there may be an opportunity to retry the roll &mdash; that is, to **recast** the die. 

Similarly, self-directed learning is marked by iteration through trial-and-error, design-and-test &mdash; figuring things out by trying and trying again. In this way, the D20 {{< awesome fas fa-dice-d20 >}} and the ability to **recast** are fitting symbols of self-directed learning.
