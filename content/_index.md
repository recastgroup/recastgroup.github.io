## Research and Exploration of Culturally Affirming Self-Teaching

We are the *Research and Exploration of Culturally Affirming Self-Teaching* (**RECAST**) group, a research team gathered and led by [Dr. Bret Staudt Willet]. We are based in the Instructional Systems and Learning Technologies ([ISLT]) program at Florida State University, but our contributors and collaborators are global in scope.

## Land Acknowledgement

### We Honor Native Land

We live and work in Tallahassee, Florida, on the traditional land of the Apalachee, Muscogee, and Miccosukee Peoples. We share this land acknowledgement to demonstrate our commitment to learning and working to dismantle the ongoing legacies of settler colonialism. 

We recognize that this land remains scarred by the histories and ongoing legacies of settler colonial violence, dispossession, and removal. In spite of all of this, and with tremendous resilience, these Indigenous Nations have remained deeply connected to this territory, to their families, to their communities, and to their cultural ways of life. We recognize the ongoing relationships of care that these Indigenous Nations maintain with this land and extend our gratitude as we live and work as humble and respectful guests upon their territory. 

We encourage you to learn about and amplify the contemporary work of the Indigenous nations whose land you are on and to endeavor to support Indigenous sovereignty in all the ways that you can. To start learning, we have found the [Native Land map] to be fascinating to explore, and the [Honor Native Land guide] from the U.S. Department of Arts & Culture has many useful resources. Finally, if you are in the Tallahassee area, you may find this [list of resources from the Decolonize FSU group] to be helpful.
