## Webinar Overview:

Join us for a webinar exploring **self-directed learning within specific contexts**. Our panelists have studied self-directed learning in five distinct sectors (language learning, cybersecurity, behavior analysis, nursing, and game development) and will reflect on the various definitions and models of self-directed learning they have incorporated into their work, the insights and lessons learned about self-directed learning in their contexts, and how self-directed learning should be applied moving forward. The audience will be invited to share their own experiences to broaden the depth and scope of conversation, situating self-directed learning in even more contexts.

## Panel:

The conversation will be facilitated by Dr. Bret Staudt Willet, and guest panelists include RECAST team members Vania Aguilar, Sudeshna Aich, Anika Costa, Nina Davis, and Zhongyu Wang.
