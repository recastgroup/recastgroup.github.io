## Podcast Episode Overview:

Join four game designers as they discuss the role of games and play in learning. Drs. Tricia Seifert,  Colleen Smith, Tracy Fullerton, and Andrew Peterson challenge the misalignment of education as only linear and structured and explore the paradox of play –  how games’ mystery, rules, and openness can create space for creativity, connection, emotion, learning, and more.
